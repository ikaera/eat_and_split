# Eat and Split

## Description

**Eat and Split** is a clean, interactive React app designed to help users fairly and quickly split shared bills with a friend. Whether youâ€™re dining out, traveling, or just sharing everyday expenses, this app helps track who owes what with a few simple inputs.

### ðŸ’¡ Motivation

The inspiration behind this project was to build something practical and immediately useful while deepening my understanding of modern React concepts. I wanted to challenge myself with building a responsive UI and managing shared state between components effectively.

### ðŸš€ Why I Built It

I built _Eat and Split_ to solidify my React knowledge beyond the basics. It was important to work on a project that mimicked real-world logic and user interactionsâ€”such as form validation, controlled components, and conditional renderingâ€”while keeping the code modular and clean.

### ðŸ§° What Problem It Solves

Splitting a bill can often be a confusing or awkward process. This app removes the hassle by clearly calculating who owes whom based on user input:

- Who paid
- How much was the total bill
- Each personâ€™s share

It ensures that overpayments are not allowed and keeps the UX friendly and transparent.

### ðŸ“š What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Manage form inputs using controlled components
- Lift state up to share data across components
- Perform input validation and dynamic calculations
- Design reusable components
- Handle conditional UI logic
- Apply best practices for file structure, readability, and reusability

It was also a great exercise in UI/UX thinkingâ€”creating a layout that is easy to use and communicates its purpose clearly to the user.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
